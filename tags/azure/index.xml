      <description>If your application is connecting to Azure database, or any other resources, then connecting them through Virtual Network (VNet) will enhance the performance (assuming the app service and the resources are in the same region), as well it enhance the security and we can lock the resources to have private endpoint, and not accessed publicly. I am going to go through a walk-through tutorial, using Azure Sql Server as an example, but this can work with any database on Azure, or even any resources like blob storage.</description>

      <description>As a developer who dealt with the cloud, either to create a virtual machine, or to deploy a website that connect to a database, then most probabely you had to deal even in short with a private network. And most of us developers don&amp;rsquo;t know a lot about networking, because it is either the job of dev-ops or system administrator. But on the cloud you find that you have to take some decisions related to the networking.</description>

      <description>I was trying to setup a deployment for an SPA application to an Azure Static Web app using TeamCity, but most of the tutorials I found was doing the deployment through CI/CD of Github&amp;rsquo;s Actions by monitoring a specific branch of a Github repository and deploy automatically whenever we check in into that branch, or the other alternative is using Azure DevOps pipeline. But what if we don&amp;rsquo;t want to use neither, and instead we need to do it on demand from TeamCity, or any other CI/CD tool?</description>

      <description>When you use Kubernetes CLI tool: kubectl that is installed while you installed Docker Desktop for Windows, there is a small glitch that it will fail the kubectl commands, because of Kubeconfig file.
Let&amp;rsquo;s supposed you want to create a new cluster on AKS, as follows:
1az aks create --resource-group MyResourceGropu --name MyMicroserviceCluster --node-count 1 --enable-addons http_application_routing --generate-ssh-keys And then you need to set that new cluster as your default cluster to work on, so you use</description>
