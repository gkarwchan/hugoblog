      <description>What is a watchdogA watchdog is a service that monitor other services and take actions when it detect a service is failing.
ASP.NET starting from Core 5 has a built in UI module to monitor other services, and in few line of code you can build a watchdog for your services.
How to hook it up with your services:Your microservices should implement health check endpoints to be monitored by the orchestration service (Kubernetes, docker storm, &amp;hellip; etc).</description>

      <description>Kubernetes Monitoring:Kubernetes monitors the deployed microservices and check if any failure or a deadlock that makes the service not responding in order to restart the hosting container.
Kubernetes achieve this by calling three different probes that determine the status of the container/pod. The three probes are:
liveness: which monitor any deadlock, or the service is down, and Kubernetes will remove the dead container and restart another one. startup: Your service might need time at startup to wait for all its dependencies to be ready.</description>

      <description>Why this post?Looking at the new ASP.NET 6 and its minimal hosting model, triggered some thoughts comparing it to ASP.NET 2, and made me think if Microsoft going back to some old concepts. And was questioning the real benefits of migrating to this model. So let me explain, and compare it with ASP.NET version 5 and 2.

      <description>It is critical not to store passwords or API keys in our code.
For all environments for the development process: (QA, UAT, Pre-Production, and Production), it is easier to place it in a safe place (Azure Key Vault for example), and access it during deployment.
For developer machines, we can use Secret Manager, or sometimes called User Secrets, which has a built-in support in ASP.NET.
Enable Secret Storage:In the project you want to add a secret run this command:</description>
