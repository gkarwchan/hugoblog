      <description>When working on distributed system like systems that are running on the cloud, and microservices, then you should anticipate transient faults like temporary loss of network connection, or temporary unavailability of a service, or a service is busy.
This is why in cloud application, the term Building for resiliency become a pattern in building application, and it means properly handling these transient faults in the code.
There are two common used patterns that we can use in our code, that can help build resilience application.</description>

      <title>Everything you need to know about telemetry for your Asp.NET application on Azure.</title>

      <description>All of the services that Azure offers for the instrumentation and observability (monitoring) of applications are grouped under Azure Monitor.
Three services fall under the banner of Azure Monitor:
Azure Monitor itself, which offers the observability component to track your apps. Application Insights, or its substitute OpenTelemetry, which offers the instrumentation and telemetry components The analytics component is provided by Log Analytics. We will emphasise the instrumentation component in this post.</description>

      <title>Implement a watchdog for your microservices using off-the-shelf ASP.Net Healthcheck UI.</title>

      <description>What is a watchdogA watchdog is a service that monitor other services and take actions when it detect a service is failing.
ASP.NET starting from Core 5 has a built in UI module to monitor other services, and in few line of code you can build a watchdog for your services.
How to hook it up with your services:Your microservices should implement health check endpoints to be monitored by the orchestration service (Kubernetes, docker storm, &amp;hellip; etc).</description>

      <title>Take your development environment anywhere and on any machine with Dev Containers</title>

      <description>Dev containers provides a fantastic way to onboard a new developer up and running in matter of just clone the git repository.
Dev containers allow you to create a docker container that will host all the development tools and libraries you use in your projects, and run it inside the container, and if you have an editor compatible then you can make the IDE connect to the containers and you can run or debug your code inside the containers.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes Monitoring:Kubernetes monitors the deployed microservices and check if any failure or a deadlock that makes the service not responding in order to restart the hosting container.
Kubernetes achieve this by calling three different probes that determine the status of the container/pod. The three probes are:
liveness: which monitor any deadlock, or the service is down, and Kubernetes will remove the dead container and restart another one. startup: Your service might need time at startup to wait for all its dependencies to be ready.</description>

      <title>Some thoughts about ASP.NET Minimal API and Minimal Hosting Model</title>
      <link>https://www.ghassan.page/posts/2022_12_19_aspnet_minimal_api/</link>

      <description>Why this post?ASP.NET 6&amp;rsquo;s minimal hosting model made me compare it to ASP.NET 2 and wonder if Microsoft is going back to some old concepts. I was curious about the potential benefit of migration, so I intend to explain and compare ASP.NET 6, 5 and 2.

      <title>Using Secret Manager for Configuration in .NET</title>

      <description>It is critical not to store passwords or API keys in our code.
For all environments for the development process: (QA, UAT, Pre-Production, and Production), it is easier to place it in a safe place (Azure Key Vault for example), and access it during deployment.
For developer machines, we can use Secret Manager, or sometimes called User Secrets, which has a built-in support in ASP.NET.
Enable Secret Storage:In the project you want to add a secret run this command:</description>
